<p>And if you want to ask somebody to do something, explaining the reason why always makes the email even more effective. If you put a lot of rigmarole before your ask, an impatient reader might never get to it. Doubtless you have asked someone to do somethingfor you, and he responded in a reluctant way, or in a way that made you feel very small and unworthy, or foolish. It would also be good if you indicate that your reason for asking is not that you think they would do a bad job of handling the matter, but rather you have thought of a better way. Say “hello” at the beginning of your request.</p>

<p>The way you ask someone to do something has the majority of impact on whether or not you will effectively persuade them or be vigorously blocked by their innate defenses. Say “hello” at the beginning of your request. For example, let's say you're in a restaurant. The fourth step towards a great ask is your expression, many times our words and tone are proper but still, we fail to get a positive outcome, it happens because our body language share a different story to the opposite person, instead of looking humble sweet and polite, we look rude, we look as if we are doing some kind of favor to the opposite person, while asking for. And ask someone to something to invite someone to something.</p>

<p>Use “would you do me a favor.” this is often used and you must use it when you are asking for a special request or favor. To give you more context, i have a timing issue with one of my classes at university, and my professor is working on the issue. Start with a basic greeting (e.g. When you ask someone for something, or you ask them to do something for you, it is essential to be as polite as possible. Be polite by asking if they’ve looked it over rather than accuse or point out that you haven’t received it yet.</p>
